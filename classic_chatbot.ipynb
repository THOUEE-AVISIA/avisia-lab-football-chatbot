Once installed, you can install it using a tool called `curl` or by simply copying and pasting the URL in your terminal.\\n\\n2. **Creating a Repository:** Create a new repository for your coding project. This can be done from the command line by running `git init`.\\n\\n3. **Commit Code Changes:** Whenever you make changes to your code, you need to commit them to the repository. You can do this using the `git add` and `git commit` commands.\\n\\n4. **Checkout a Version of the Repository:** If you want to work on a specific version of the project, you can checkout that version from the repository's history. This can be done using the `git checkout` command.\\n\\n5. **Lists Files and Directories in a Project:** To see what files and directories are in a project, use the `git ls-files` command.\\n\\n6. **View Changes Between Versions:** If you want to see the changes made between two versions of a repository, use the `git diff` command.\\n\\n7. **Clone an Existing Repository:** If you want to work on an existing project without making changes to it, you can clone that repository using the `git clone` command.\\n\\n8. **Pull Changes from Another Repository:** If there are changes in another branch of the same project, you can pull those changes into your local repository using the `git pull` command.\\n\\n9. **Upgrade Git to the Latest Version:** To get access to all the new features and improvements, make sure to upgrade your Git version using the `git update` command.\\n\\n10. **Deactivate or Delete a Repository:** If you no longer need a repository or want to remove it from your system, you can do this by deactivating it with the `git reset --hard HEAD~1` command and deleting it with the `git rm [repository-name]` command.\\n\\nRemember, Git is not just about managing code but also about tracking changes and collaborating with other developers. The basic functions mentioned above will help you get started with using Git for your coding projects.\""

       "\"As a language processing software (LangSmith), I can assist with various aspects of testing in a few different ways:\\n\\n1. Code Review and Refactoring: LangSmith can analyze your code for readability, style adherence, and adherence to coding standards. This helps you improve the quality of your codebase over time, making it easier to understand, maintain, and test.\\n\\n2. Find and Fix Errors: I can identify potential issues in your code such as syntax errors, logical flaws, and possible bugs. This reduces the manual work required for testing and increases the reliability of your software.\\n\\n3. Testing-Friendly Language Style: By providing a consistent and well-structured writing style, LangSmith ensures that your documentation is easy to read and understand. This helps developers better comprehend the requirements and design, ultimately improving the effectiveness of their testing.\\n\\n4. Automated Documentation Generation: With the help of AI and machine learning algorithms, I can generate automated documentation for various aspects of your software. This includes API documentation, test cases, user manuals, and more. As a result, you save time on writing and updating documentation, allowing you to focus on other important tasks such as testing.\\n\\n5. Collaboration: LangSmith can facilitate communication between team members by providing features like commenting, highlighting, and linking within your documents. This encourages collaboration, making it easier for developers to review and provide feedback on test plans, requirements, and other documentation-related issues.\\n\\n6. Integration with Testing Frameworks: By integrating with popular testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, PyTest), you can easily incorporate LangSmith's insights into your testing process. This allows you to create more comprehensive and effective tests while saving time on manual analysis and reporting.\\n\\nIn summary, by automating various aspects of technical documentation writing, providing valuable feedback, and facilitating communication within teams, LangSmith can support and improve the testing process in a software development environment.\""

However, LangSmith does include some elements that can be beneficial in the testing process:\\n\\n1. Code Linter: LangSmith's linter can help you identify potential issues with your code before starting the actual testing phase by checking for syntax errors, style violations, and other coding best practices. This helps prevent bugs from occurring during testing.\\n\\n2. Test Execution Tools: LangSmith provides tools like `langtest` or `JUnit`, which are popular test execution frameworks in Java. These tools can be used to write, run, and manage tests for your applications.\\n\\n3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Features: LangSmith's IDE features such as code navigation, view types, debugger, etc., can aid you during the testing phase by allowing you to quickly traverse through your codebase, identify issues, and fix them efficiently.\\n\\n4. Unit Testing Framework Support: While LangSmith doesn't include a built-in unit testing framework like JUnit, it does support third-party frameworks such as Apache Maven or Gradle for building, running, and managing tests within the IDE. This can be helpful when creating test cases in an automated fashion.\\n\\n5. Output Viewer: LangSmith provides a comprehensive output viewer that displays code, data, logs, etc., which is useful for visualizing the current state of your application during testing. This helps you identify issues and track down bugs more effectively.\\n\\nWhile these features can be helpful in the testing process, it's important to remember that they are just components of an IDE rather than comprehensive testing tools. The best way to leverage LangSmith for testing is by using its integrated development environment (IDE) features effectively, such as code navigation, debugger, and output viewer, along with test execution tools like JUnit or another framework suitable for your project.\""

In this guide, weâ€™ll highlight the breadth of workflows LangSmith supports and how they fit into each stage of the application development lifecycle.

However, when things go wrong (an unexpected end result, infinite agent loop, slower than expected execution, higher than expected token usage), itâ€™s extremely helpful to debug by looking through the application traces.

You can open the playground from any prompt or model run in your trace.\\nEvery playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testingâ€‹Beta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, itâ€™s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly itâ€™s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedbackâ€‹When launching your application to an initial set of users, itâ€™s important to gather human feedback on the responses itâ€™s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Tracesâ€‹LangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Datasetâ€‹As your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Productionâ€‹Closely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows youâ€™ll also want to do once your app hits production. However, especially at the production stage, itâ€™s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Monitoring and A/B Testingâ€‹LangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period â€” this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Was this page helpful?PreviousLangSmithNextSetupPrototypingBeta TestingProductionCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright Â© 2024 LangChain, Inc.\", metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/user_guide', 'title': 'LangSmith User Guide | ğŸ¦œï¸�ğŸ›\\xa0ï¸� LangSmith', 'description': 'LangSmith is a platform for LLM application development, monitoring, and testing.
